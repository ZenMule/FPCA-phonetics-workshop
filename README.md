# Workshop on Functional PCA for Phonetics and Prosody
This repository contains didactic material for a workshop on Functional PCA for phonetics and prosody that I provide on request.
This material is not suitable for autonomous study, rather it is there to support the workshop activities. 

## Installation and prerequisites
Please follow the instructions in scripts/INSTALL.txt, otherwise you will encounter unpleasant surprises :)
