Installation and prerequisites
==============================

Basically you only need R, your favourite IDE, like RStudio, and the 'fda' R
package.

The only IMPORTANT thing is to install an older version of the fda
package. (Aapparently the authors of the fda package have changed the code breaking backward compatibility without saying anything in any comment log.)

Please install fda_2.4.0 instead of the latest. 
You find the file fda_2.4.0.tar.gz in the scripts/ folder, or you can download it from CRAN:
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/fda/fda_2.4.0.tar.gz
and then from the R console:
install.packages("you/path/to/fda_2.4.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
